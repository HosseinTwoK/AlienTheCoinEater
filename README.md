Python PyGame Project - Object Oriented - Alien The Coin Eater 
---------------------------------------------------------------
Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

My First Pygame Project ðŸŽ®

After just three days of watching videos and reading Pygame docs, I finally made my first small game!

Itâ€™s a tiny OOP-based project where you can move a character, collect coins, and track score and lives. Iâ€™m learning animations, collisions, and sounds along the way.

Iâ€™d love feedback on how to improve the code and make the game more fun. Future plans include power-ups, enemies, and more levels!
